2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: cd 02-Basic-React-Hooks-useState-useRef-useEffect - `cd m6-add-rest-data-to-server-side-rendering`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`

## Directory Structure Here

Each of the 5 folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

And that will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`

## Background

This course uses the Next.js framework as a demonstraton vehicle for React Hooks. If you want to know more about Next.js you should watch my other course on Pluralsight titled "Building Server-side Rendered React Apps for Beginners". You can find it [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-server-side-rendered-react-apps-beginners).
